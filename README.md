# Moving Average DSP Algorithm: Posit vs Float Benchmarking

## Overview

This repository contains benchmarking code and results comparing the performance and accuracy of moving average DSP algo

### Moving Average Filters

Moving average filters are fundamental DSP components used for smoothing signals and reducing random noise while retaining a sharp step response

## Benchmarking

Both formats filters are becnhmarked using, filtering time, Memory usage, SNR ratio, Mean Squared Error, Max Absoulute Error and Energy conservation.
